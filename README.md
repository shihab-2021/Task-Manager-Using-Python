# Task manger project by Python

Small task management project by using _**python.**_

After running the project, this will show you:

_**1\. ADD NEW TASK**_  
_**2\. SHOW ALL TASK**_  
_**3\. SHOW INCOMPLETE TASK**_  
_**4\. SHOW COMPLETED TASK**_  
_**5\. UPDATE TASK**_  
_**6\. MARK A TASK COMPLETED**_  
_**7\. EXIT**_  

You have to enter your choice, then the rest will come one by one.

Thank you.
